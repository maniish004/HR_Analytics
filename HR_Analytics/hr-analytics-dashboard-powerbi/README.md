## **Overview**

**HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI** is an end-to-end data analytics project that transforms a raw HR dataset into a clean, interactive Power BI report.

The dashboard surfaces key HR questions:

- How many employees do we have, and in which job roles?
- What is our gender distribution across the organisation?
- How are employees distributed by age and qualification?
- How do salary and leave patterns vary by role and education?
- How has our team grown over time?

The project is inspired by the classic HR analytics dashboard walkthrough for Power BI and extended with multiple detailed analysis pages, DAX measures, and clean report layout.

<br>

### **Project Highlights**

- **End-to-end Power BI workflow:** Import, clean, model, and visualise HR data from Excel.
- **Simple star schema model:** Central `Staff` table plus a `Qualification Dimension` table.
- **Reusable DAX measures:** Headcount, average salary, min/max salary, average leave, staff with high leave balance, and cumulative headcount.
- **Multi-page design:** One main dashboard + focused drill-down pages (job count, gender, age, salary, leave, employee index).
- **Portfolio-ready:** Clear layout, descriptive titles, and business-friendly wording suitable for interviews and data-analytics portfolios.

### **Project Structure**

A typical layout of this repository:

    hr-analytics-dashboard-powerbi/
    ├─ HR_Dashboard.pbix              # Main Power BI report
    ├─ data/
    │  └─ HR_Staff_Data.xlsx          # HR dataset (embedded or used for refresh)

### **Prerequisites**

- **Operating System**
  - Windows 10 or later (Power BI Desktop is Windows-only at the moment).
- **Power BI Desktop**
  - Download from the official Microsoft Power BI download page.  
  - Either install from the Microsoft Store or via the standalone installer.  
- **Excel or CSV Viewer (optional)**

---

### **Installation**

You have two main options: cloning via Git or downloading the ZIP.

1. **Clone the repository (recommended)**

   - In a terminal:

     - git clone https://github.com/brej-29/hr-analytics-dashboard-powerbi.git
     - cd hr-analytics-dashboard-powerbi

2. **Download ZIP (no Git needed)**

   - Go to the GitHub repository page.
   - Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**.
   - Extract the ZIP to a local folder.

After either method, you should see `HR_Dashboard.pbix` and the `data/` & `screenshots/` folders locally.

---

### **Configuration**

Depending on how the `.pbix` is set up, you may or may not need to re-point the data source.

1. **Open the report**
   - Launch **Power BI Desktop**.
   - Open `HR_Dashboard.pbix`.

2. **Check data source**
   - If the report opens without any warnings, the data is already embedded and you can explore immediately.
   - If you see a **“Couldn’t find the data source”** or **“Permission”** warning:
     - Go to **Home > Transform data > Data source settings**.
     - Edit the file path to point to your local copy of `data/HR_Staff_Data.xlsx`.
     - Apply changes and refresh.

3. **Refresh the dataset**
   - Click **Home > Refresh** to reload the data and recompute measures.

---

### **Usage**

Once the report is open in Power BI Desktop:

1. **Main HR Dashboard**
   - Start on the main page to see:

     - KPI cards for headcount, average salary, average leave, high-leave employees.
     - Job role bar chart, gender pie, age distribution.
     - Salary vs qualification scatter.
     - Cumulative headcount over time.

   - Use the filters or slicers (if present) to slice data by job title, gender, or other dimensions.

2. **Navigate to Analysis Pages**
   - Use the **page tabs** at the bottom of Power BI:

     - `Job Count`
     - `Gender Job Analysis`
     - `Age Analysis`
     - `Salary Analysis`
     - `Salary Employee Analysis`
     - `Salary Qualification Analysis`
     - `Employee Count Analysis`
     - `Employee Index`
     - `Leave Balance Analysis`

   - Each page focuses on one analytical angle:
     - Job roles, diversity, demographics, salary structure, leave balances, or individual employees.

3. **Interactivity & Exploration**
   - Hover over charts to view tooltips (individual data points).
   - Click on bars, slices, or scatter points to cross-filter other visuals.
   - Experiment with different combinations of filters to answer HR questions such as:
     - “Which roles have the highest average salary?”
     - “What is the age and gender mix in specific job titles?”
     - “Which employees have unusually high or low salaries?”
     - “Which roles accumulate more unused leave?”

4. **Modifying the Report (Optional)**
   - Use **Model view** to inspect the relationship between `Staff` and `Qualification Dimension`.
   - Open **Power Query** to review data cleaning steps.
   - Add your own measures and visuals to extend the project.
